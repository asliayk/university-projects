# LinkedList-Implementation

I implemented a C++ program for generating the statistics on the expense records of a group of people. The expense records
will be provided in the input file. The program reads the input file and stores the valuable information in the records in a LinkedList. As a final step, 
it calculates the expected statistics over the LinkedList.

An example of an input data: <br />
5 <br />
Ali bought a pencil with $5 <br />
Ayse spent $80 for clothing <br />
Mine ordered a course book for $100 <br />
Ahmet spent $100 for his new bag <br />
Ali bought a notebook with $20 <br />

The correct result is: <br />
20 100 75

# Memory-Game

Me and my friends have developed a QT program that implements “Find The Pair” game. We assumed the program is to be implemented as a one-person game. We also should report how many pairs we find out of the number of tries. We assumed the cards are implemented as buttons with letters and the letter X represents the back of the cards.

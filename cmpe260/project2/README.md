# A-Grocery-Implementation

In this project, I wrote some Scheme functions(statements) for manipulating lists of farms, customers and crops. I extracted different sorts of information from a database of farms, customers and crops in an agricultural area. The database is encoded as a list of entries, with one entry for each farm, one entry for each customer and multiple entries for crops.

# Shell-Example

I have implemented my own shell (i.e Command Line Interpreter) which is composed of a set of certain commands. It waits for the command to be entered by the user, it is executed as soon as it is requested, and the program starts to wait for another command after the command is successfully completed. The program will continue to run until the interrupt signal or the command is entered "exit".
